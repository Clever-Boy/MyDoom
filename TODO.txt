In Progress

- FEATURE: pre-link things to their sprites?

- BUG: when there's a short-sector (upper texture, no lower) before a door, the floor plane isn't drawn
- BUG: looking down over stairs doesn't break the floor like I'd expect it to

Queued up

- FEATURE: render flats instead of red/green: http://www.johnromero.com/lee_killough/editing/visplane.shtml

- BUG: When a lineseg is long or close, and maybe spans both FOV vectors, it gets clipped but shouldn't.

- CHORE: refactor seg::render
  - CHORE: consider refactoring “player-centric segment” a class (then forgetting about player)
  - CHORE: consider refactoring “clipped, player-centric segment” another class

- BUG: top of wall is rounded in final room (z projection is wrong)

- FEATURE: use rgba (instead of rgb) for textures, sprites, flats
- FEATURE: render the transparent (masked) walls back-to-front AFTER the solid walls (and visplanes).
