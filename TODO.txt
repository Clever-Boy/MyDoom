- BUG: sometimes, crazy OOB-ey pixels are drawn

- FEATURE: render flats instead of red/green: http://www.johnromero.com/lee_killough/editing/visplane.shtml

- BUG: When a lineseg is long or close, and maybe spans both FOV vectors, it gets clipped but shouldn't.
- BUG: View height seems to height. And player doesn't step up soon enough, on stairs.

- CHORE: refactor seg::render
  - CHORE: consider refactoring “player-centric segment” a class (then forgetting about player)
  - CHORE: consider refactoring “clipped, player-centric segment” another class
- CHORE: refactor height (z) into 3d vertex class

- BUG: top of wall is rounded in final room (z projection is wrong)

- FEATURE: use rgba (instead of rgb) for textures, sprites, flats
- FEATURE: render the transparent (masked) walls back-to-front AFTER the solid walls (and visplanes).
  See: http://fabiensanglard.net/doomIphone/doomClassicRenderer.php ("The big picture of runtime"
  and "Things and transparent walls.")
  - Can I NOT do this, and instead rely on alpha transparency? For non-solid walls, I could use 
    overlay_pixel() instead of draw_pixel()

- FEATURE: lighting
  - FEATURE: user darker color palettes for further-away objects
  - FEATURE: increase lighting where wall lights are
- FEATURE: animate wall textures

- FEATURE: head bobbing

- FEATURE: collision detection: http://doom.wikia.com/wiki/Blockmap

- FEATURE: trigger walkover actions on linedefs
- FEATURE: trigger use/push actions on linedefs
