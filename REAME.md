## Why?

For fun. And nastolgia. 

## Why from scratch? 

To better understand its algorithms. The original implementation is excessively difficult to understand because it is so impressively optimized. Modern computers have so much more horsepower that it is possible to reimplement cleanly, without all the optimization, thereby better exposing the beauty of the core algorithms

## Details

Compiles & runs on OS X 10.0, with clang++.
